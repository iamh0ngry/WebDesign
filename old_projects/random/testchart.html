The characters are absolutely phenominal, and I think it kind of sets a lesson that you are not alone, and that you don't have to pretend anything to make yourself better and more known.</td>

The way they portrayed their characters were great, Racetrack did really well with dancing with a CIGAR IN HIS MOUTH. Crutchie did really well with his crutch and all, though he wasn't really dancing which bummed me out a little.</td>

It gives the main characters a little bit more backstory (like beetlejuice), and it really ties together in a way that everyone is beautiful in their own way.
