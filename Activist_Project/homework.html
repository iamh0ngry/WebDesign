        <h1>Homework Should Be Banned!</h1>
        <p id="caption">By Alex and Riell</p>
        
        <p>There are so many arguments regarding whether homework should be banned from all school systems. Homework isn't the only way kids learn. There are many other ways you can support your child's learning outside the classroom, from unstructured play to fostering curiosity and reading together. There have been so many pros and cons to homework, and no one can decide on a sollution. Homework can create good study habits, lead to higher achievement, and helps students learn topics better. Although, homework can cause damage to your health, mind, and overall well-being. Kids have to go through studing on the daily, taking away important activities, and constant sleep depravation from screens. They should not be worrying about getting their homework assignments done, and let their creativity flow, along with learning and getting good grades. These reason should surely convince you to finally banning homework for good!</p>
        <h2>Reason #1: Self Care</h2> 
        <p id="constant_studying">With the help of homework being brought onto students, these children could end up not getting any time to go outside. Children are obligated to sit tediously at their desk, solving problems that they won't even need in their near future. The National Center for Education Statistics found that high school students get an average of 6.8 hours and elementary students get an average of 4.7 hours of homework each week. The average teenager now spends about twice as much time on homework as teenagers did in the 1990s. This is more than what is recommended by experts. Not only is physical activity decreasing from homework, family bonding also decreases, causing constant family arguments and avoidance(see reason #2). Children could also be avoiding meals or sleep, resulting in severe health problems with major side effects. Overall, a child's work ethic could result in bad behaviors and an unhealthy physical appearance.</p><img id="noah" src="42o5FwZ.png" width="150" height="200">
        <h2>Reason #2: More Anxiety</h2>
        <p>When doing homework or even studying, this certain pressure can lead to an increase in anxiety and/or depression. The overwhelming nervousness following you around about getting assignments done and making sure you're prepared for a test clouds you like a storm. This could result in random outbreaks of rage and constant annoyance. You could also become easily irritated or enraged for the littlest of sounds such as gum chewing or tapping one's foot on the ground. When parents become controlling or aggresive over grades, they can cause the child to have a deep fear of failure, working well into the night to get an assignment perfectly. This is definetely not healthy for children to deal with and should be stopped.</p><img id="desks" src="random_desks2.png" width="200" height="200">
        <h2>Reason #3: Screen Time</h2>
        <p>Nowadays, technology has become a valid part of our day to day lives. Instead of the old-fashioned pen and paper technique, we use our computers to answer problems with google and calculators. However, studies suggest that continued exposure to the blue light on computers over time could lead to damaged retinal cells. This can cause vision problems like age-related macular degeneration. Staring at screens also cause the difficulty of going to sleep easily. If you're on your device before going to sleep, it will be more difficult than if you went to sleep without looking at your device. Therefore, if you're on your screen for an painstakingly long time, it could lead to severe burnout/insomnia.</p><img id="homework" src="homework2.png" height="200" width="200">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The constant dabocles about banning homework from school systems should be resolved. Though there are some things that are extremely beneficial to a child's acedemic health, there are also painful controversies that lead to severe health difficulties. Children should not be put on this much pressure, working 4-6 hours a weeks solving for x that might not be important in the future. Children should be able to embrace their creativity and follow a metaphorical path of fun, happy childhood. You should be able to spend time being a kid until it's too late.</p><img id="rocks" src="trail_of_rocks2.png" width="160" height="200">
